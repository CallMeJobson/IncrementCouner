# Incrementing Counter Widget

Created a small  incrementing counter. This could be use for any the of counting done on a website.

This was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Something I learned.

I learned about the get attribute method in JavaScript.
This method returns a string! and buy using the + operator in front it converts it into a number.
